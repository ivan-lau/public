Sure! Here's a Python function that implements the binomial pricing model with the Vellekoop-Nieuwenhuis adjustment:

```python
import math

def binomial_pricing_with_vn(S, K, r, T, sigma, N, dividends):
    """
    Calculates the option price using the binomial pricing model with Vellekoop-Nieuwenhuis adjustment.
    
    Args:
        S (float): Current price of the underlying asset.
        K (float): Strike price of the option.
        r (float): Risk-free interest rate.
        T (float): Time to expiration in years.
        sigma (float): Volatility of the underlying asset.
        N (int): Number of time steps in the binomial tree.
        dividends (list): List of tuples representing dividend payments. Each tuple contains the dividend amount and the time step when it is paid.
        
    Returns:
        float: Option price.
    """
    delta_t = T / N
    up_factor = math.exp(sigma * math.sqrt(delta_t))
    down_factor = 1 / up_factor
    p = (math.exp(r * delta_t) - down_factor) / (up_factor - down_factor)
    
    # Build the binomial tree
    tree = [[0.0] * (i + 1) for i in range(N + 1)]
    tree[0][0] = S
    
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        for j in range(i):
            tree[i][j] = tree[i-1][j] * up_factor
        tree[i][i] = tree[i-1][i-1] * down_factor
    
    # Apply Vellekoop-Nieuwenhuis adjustment
    for dividend in dividends:
        dividend_amount, dividend_step = dividend
        adjustment_factor = math.exp(-r * dividend_step * delta_t)
        for j in range(dividend_step, N + 1):
            tree[j][dividend_step] -= dividend_amount * adjustment_factor
    
    # Calculate option payoffs at expiration
    option_values = [max(tree[N][j] - K, 0) for j in range(N + 1)]
    
    # Perform backward recursion to calculate option values at each node
    for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
        for j in range(i + 1):
            option_values[j] = (p * option_values[j] + (1 - p) * option_values[j + 1]) / math.exp(r * delta_t)
    
    return option_values[0]
```

You can use this function by providing the necessary inputs such as the current price of the underlying asset (`S`), strike price of the option (`K`), risk-free interest rate (`r`), time to expiration in years (`T`), volatility of the underlying asset (`sigma`), number of time steps in the binomial tree (`N`), and the list of dividend payments (`dividends`). The function will return the option price.

Note that the function assumes European-style options and uses a risk-neutral probability (`p`) to calculate the option values. Also, make sure to provide the dividend payments as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the dividend amount and the time step when it is paid.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
