Certainly! Here's a simple example that demonstrates how to use the `engine::application` class and the `ENGINE_GAME` macro to create a custom game class and run it:

First, create a new directory for the project and create a file called `engine.hpp` with the following contents:

```
#ifndef ENGINE_HPP
#define ENGINE_HPP

#include <iostream>

namespace engine {

    // Base class for game applications
    class application {
    public:
        virtual ~application() {}

        // Main game loop
        virtual void run() {
            std::cout << "Running game...\n";
            DoSomething();
        }

        // Override this function in the derived class to do something
        virtual void DoSomething() {}
    };

    // Game engine class
    class game {
    public:
        game(application* app) : app_(app) {}
        ~game() {}

        // Run the game
        void run() {
            app_->run();
        }

    private:
        application* app_;
    };

} // namespace engine

#endif // ENGINE_HPP
```

This header file defines the `engine::application` and `engine::game` classes that are used in the example code you posted earlier.

Next, create a file called `my_game.hpp` with the following contents:

```
#ifndef MY_GAME_HPP
#define MY_GAME_HPP

#include "engine.hpp"

class my_game : public engine::application {
public:
    void DoSomething() override {
        std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
    }
};

// Register the game class with the engine
ENGINE_GAME(my_game);

#endif // MY_GAME_HPP
```

This header file defines a custom game class called `my_game` that inherits from `engine::application` and overrides its `DoSomething()` function. It also uses the `ENGINE_GAME` macro to register the `my_game` class with the game engine.

Finally, create a file called `main.cpp` with the following contents:

```
#include "engine.hpp"
#include "my_game.hpp"

int main() {
    // Create a new game instance and run it
    engine::game* game = new engine::game(new my_game());
    game->run();
    delete game;
    return 0;
}
```

This file creates a new game instance and runs it using the `engine::game` class.

To build and run the project, you can use a command like the following (assuming you're using `g++` as your compiler):

```
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o game && ./game
```

This should compile the code and output "Running game..." followed by "Hello World!" to the console.

Certainly! Here's an example of how you could modify your example to use a similar technique:

```cpp
// TestInterface.h
class TestInterface {
public:
    virtual void runTest() = 0;
    virtual ~TestInterface() {}
};

// TestRegistry.h
#include <memory>
#include <vector>
#include "TestInterface.h"

class TestRegistry {
public:
    void registerTest(std::unique_ptr<TestInterface> test);
    void runTests();

private:
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<TestInterface>> m_tests;
};

// TestRegistry.cpp
#include "TestRegistry.h"

void TestRegistry::registerTest(std::unique_ptr<TestInterface> test) {
    m_tests.push_back(std::move(test));
}

void TestRegistry::runTests() {
    for (const auto& test : m_tests) {
        test->runTest();
    }
}

// ExampleTest.h
#include "TestInterface.h"

class ExampleTest : public TestInterface {
public:
    void runTest() override;
};

// ExampleTest.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "ExampleTest.h"

void ExampleTest::runTest() {
    std::cout << "Running example test\n";
}

// main.cpp
#include "TestRegistry.h"

static TestRegistry g_testRegistry;

template<class T>
struct TestRegistrar {
    TestRegistrar() {
        g_testRegistry.registerTest(std::make_unique<T>());
    }
};

#define REGISTER_TEST(TestClass) static TestRegistrar<TestClass> g_testRegistrar##TestClass;

class AnotherTest : public TestInterface {
public:
    void runTest() override;
};

void AnotherTest::runTest() {
    std::cout << "Running another test\n";
}

REGISTER_TEST(ExampleTest)
REGISTER_TEST(AnotherTest)

int main() {
    g_testRegistry.runTests();
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `TestRegistry` class is responsible for maintaining a list of registered test cases and executing them. The `registerTest` function adds a new test case to the list, and the `runTests` function executes each test case in the list.

The `ExampleTest` class is a concrete implementation of the `TestInterface` interface. It defines a simple test case that prints a message to the console.

The `TestRegistrar` class template is used to register each test case with the `TestRegistry`. The `REGISTER_TEST` macro is used to define a static instance of `TestRegistrar<TestClass>` for each test case class, which calls `g_testRegistry.registerTest` to add the test case to the list.

In `main.cpp`, the `g_testRegistry` object is created and each test case is registered using the `REGISTER_TEST` macro. The `g_testRegistry.runTests()` function is then called to execute all registered test cases.

Again, note that this is a simple example and does not include error handling or other features you would typically want in a real-world testing framework. However, it demonstrates how you can use a similar technique to the one used by `ENGINE_GAME` to register test cases without needing to include additional header files for each test case.

The key challenge here is to ensure that the AlgoTrading strategy is automatically registered without being explicitly referenced in other files. This can be achieved using a Factory pattern where we register the strategy during its static initialization, and making sure that AlgoTrading.hpp is included in the application somewhere.
