Yes, we can pack the `Car` and `CarID` classes into a static library and provide a header file that declares the classes and their interface.

Here's an example implementation:

1. First, we create a header file `car.h` that declares the `Car` and `CarID` classes and their interface:

```cpp
#ifndef CAR_H
#define CAR_H

#include <string>
#include <iostream>

class CarID {
public:
    CarID();

    const std::string& toString() const;

    bool operator==(const CarID& other) const;

    bool operator!=(const CarID& other) const;

private:
    class CarIDImpl;

    CarIDImpl* impl;
};

std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const CarID& carID);

class Car {
public:
    Car();

    const CarID& getId() const;

private:
    class CarImpl;

    CarImpl* impl;
};

#endif /* CAR_H */
```

2. Next, we create a source file `car.cpp` that defines the `Car` and `CarID` classes and their implementation:

```cpp
#include "car.h"
#include <boost/uuid/uuid.hpp>
#include <boost/uuid/uuid_generators.hpp>
#include <boost/uuid/uuid_io.hpp>

class CarID::CarIDImpl {
public:
    CarIDImpl() : id(boost::uuids::random_generator()()) {}

    const boost::uuids::uuid& getValue() const {
        return id;
    }

    bool operator==(const CarIDImpl& other) const {
        return id == other.id;
    }

    bool operator!=(const CarIDImpl& other) const {
        return !(*this == other);
    }

private:
    boost::uuids::uuid id;
};

CarID::CarID() : impl(new CarIDImpl()) {}

const std::string& CarID::toString() const {
    static std::string uuid_str = boost::uuids::to_string(impl->getValue());
    return uuid_str;
}

bool CarID::operator==(const CarID& other) const {
    return *impl == *other.impl;
}

bool CarID::operator!=(const CarID& other) const {
    return !(*this == other);
}

std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const CarID& carID) {
    os << carID.toString();
    return os;
}

class Car::CarImpl {
public:
    CarImpl() : id(CarID()) {}

    const CarID& getId() const {
        return id;
    }

private:
    CarID id;
};

Car::Car() : impl(new CarImpl()) {}

const CarID& Car::getId() const {
    return impl->getId();
}
```

3. We compile the `car.cpp` file into a static library `libcar.a` using the following command:

```
g++ -c car.cpp -o car.o
ar rcs libcar.a car.o
```

4. Finally, we create a sample program `main.cpp` that uses the `Car` class from the static library:

```cpp
#include "car.h"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    Car car1;
    Car car2;

    std::cout << "Car 1 ID: " << car1.getId() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Car 2 ID: " << car2.getId() << std::endl;

    if (car1.getId() == car2.getId()) {
        std::cout << "Car 1 and Car 2 have the same ID" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Car 1 and Car 2 have different IDs" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

5. We compile the `main.cpp` program using the `libcar.a` static library using the following command:

```
g++ main.cpp -L. -lcar -o main
```

This will produce an executable `main` that uses the `Car` class from the static library `libcar.a`.

Note that we use the `CarIDImpl` and `CarImpl` classes to hide the implementation details of the `Car` and `CarID` classes, respectively, from the header file `car.h`. This allows users of the `Car` class to create `Car` objects and get their `CarID` objects without knowing the details of how the `CarID` objects are generated or stored.


You're correct, `main.cpp` should not be included in the CMake file for building the static library. 

In the updated implementation I provided earlier, I included `main.cpp` in the same directory as `car.cpp` and `car.h`, and assumed that the user would build an executable from `main.cpp` that uses the `Car` static library. 

However, it is better practice to separate the code for the library and the code for the executable, and to include only the `car.cpp` and `car.h` files in the CMake file for building the static library. 

Here's an updated version of the `CMakeLists.txt` file that only includes the `car.cpp` and `car.h` files for building the static library:

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)

project(CarLibrary)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)

# Add the header-only library Boost
find_package(Boost REQUIRED COMPONENTS uuid)

# Create a static library for the Car and CarID classes
add_library(CarLibrary STATIC car.cpp)

# Link the Boost UUID library to the Car library
target_link_libraries(CarLibrary PRIVATE Boost::uuid)
```

This `CMakeLists.txt` file sets the minimum required version of CMake, defines the project name, and sets the C++ standard to C++11.

It then finds the Boost package and its UUID component that we use in the implementation of `CarID`, creates a static library `CarLibrary` from the `car.cpp` source file, and links the Boost UUID library to the `CarLibrary` library.

To build an executable that uses the `CarLibrary` library, you would create a separate CMake file in a separate directory (e.g., `app/CMakeLists.txt`), and include the `car.h` header file and link against the `CarLibrary` library:

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)

project(CarApp)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)

# Find the CarLibrary package
find_package(CarLibrary REQUIRED)

# Create an executable for the main program
add_executable(main main.cpp)

# Link the CarLibrary library to the main program
target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE CarLibrary)
```

This `CMakeLists.txt` file sets the minimum required version of CMake, defines the project name, and sets the C++ standard to C++11.

It then finds the `CarLibrary` package (which consists of the `car.h` header file and the `CarLibrary` static library), creates an executable `main` from the `main.cpp` source file, and links the `CarLibrary` library to the executable.

This separation of code into separate directories and CMake files makes it easier to manage dependencies, build configurations, and build processes for more complex projects.
