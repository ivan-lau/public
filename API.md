Certainly! Here's a simple example that demonstrates how to use the `engine::application` class and the `ENGINE_GAME` macro to create a custom game class and run it:

First, create a new directory for the project and create a file called `engine.hpp` with the following contents:

```
#ifndef ENGINE_HPP
#define ENGINE_HPP

#include <iostream>

namespace engine {

    // Base class for game applications
    class application {
    public:
        virtual ~application() {}

        // Main game loop
        virtual void run() {
            std::cout << "Running game...\n";
            DoSomething();
        }

        // Override this function in the derived class to do something
        virtual void DoSomething() {}
    };

    // Game engine class
    class game {
    public:
        game(application* app) : app_(app) {}
        ~game() {}

        // Run the game
        void run() {
            app_->run();
        }

    private:
        application* app_;
    };

} // namespace engine

#endif // ENGINE_HPP
```

This header file defines the `engine::application` and `engine::game` classes that are used in the example code you posted earlier.

Next, create a file called `my_game.hpp` with the following contents:

```
#ifndef MY_GAME_HPP
#define MY_GAME_HPP

#include "engine.hpp"

class my_game : public engine::application {
public:
    void DoSomething() override {
        std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
    }
};

// Register the game class with the engine
ENGINE_GAME(my_game);

#endif // MY_GAME_HPP
```

This header file defines a custom game class called `my_game` that inherits from `engine::application` and overrides its `DoSomething()` function. It also uses the `ENGINE_GAME` macro to register the `my_game` class with the game engine.

Finally, create a file called `main.cpp` with the following contents:

```
#include "engine.hpp"
#include "my_game.hpp"

int main() {
    // Create a new game instance and run it
    engine::game* game = new engine::game(new my_game());
    game->run();
    delete game;
    return 0;
}
```

This file creates a new game instance and runs it using the `engine::game` class.

To build and run the project, you can use a command like the following (assuming you're using `g++` as your compiler):

```
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o game && ./game
```

This should compile the code and output "Running game..." followed by "Hello World!" to the console.

Certainly! Here's an example of how you could modify your example to use a similar technique:

```cpp
// TestInterface.h
class TestInterface {
public:
    virtual void runTest() = 0;
    virtual ~TestInterface() {}
};

// TestRegistry.h
#include <memory>
#include <vector>
#include "TestInterface.h"

class TestRegistry {
public:
    void registerTest(std::unique_ptr<TestInterface> test);
    void runTests();

private:
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<TestInterface>> m_tests;
};

// TestRegistry.cpp
#include "TestRegistry.h"

void TestRegistry::registerTest(std::unique_ptr<TestInterface> test) {
    m_tests.push_back(std::move(test));
}

void TestRegistry::runTests() {
    for (const auto& test : m_tests) {
        test->runTest();
    }
}

// ExampleTest.h
#include "TestInterface.h"

class ExampleTest : public TestInterface {
public:
    void runTest() override;
};

// ExampleTest.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "ExampleTest.h"

void ExampleTest::runTest() {
    std::cout << "Running example test\n";
}

// main.cpp
#include "TestRegistry.h"

static TestRegistry g_testRegistry;

template<class T>
struct TestRegistrar {
    TestRegistrar() {
        g_testRegistry.registerTest(std::make_unique<T>());
    }
};

#define REGISTER_TEST(TestClass) static TestRegistrar<TestClass> g_testRegistrar##TestClass;

class AnotherTest : public TestInterface {
public:
    void runTest() override;
};

void AnotherTest::runTest() {
    std::cout << "Running another test\n";
}

REGISTER_TEST(ExampleTest)
REGISTER_TEST(AnotherTest)

int main() {
    g_testRegistry.runTests();
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `TestRegistry` class is responsible for maintaining a list of registered test cases and executing them. The `registerTest` function adds a new test case to the list, and the `runTests` function executes each test case in the list.

The `ExampleTest` class is a concrete implementation of the `TestInterface` interface. It defines a simple test case that prints a message to the console.

The `TestRegistrar` class template is used to register each test case with the `TestRegistry`. The `REGISTER_TEST` macro is used to define a static instance of `TestRegistrar<TestClass>` for each test case class, which calls `g_testRegistry.registerTest` to add the test case to the list.

In `main.cpp`, the `g_testRegistry` object is created and each test case is registered using the `REGISTER_TEST` macro. The `g_testRegistry.runTests()` function is then called to execute all registered test cases.

Again, note that this is a simple example and does not include error handling or other features you would typically want in a real-world testing framework. However, it demonstrates how you can use a similar technique to the one used by `ENGINE_GAME` to register test cases without needing to include additional header files for each test case.

I see, in that case, you can use the `PROJECT_NAME` variable provided by CMake to get the name of your project and use it to generate the `auto_gen.h` file.

Here's an updated example:

1. In your `CMakeLists.txt` file, add the following lines:

```
set(AUTO_GEN_FILE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/auto_gen.h)
file(WRITE ${AUTO_GEN_FILE} "#include \"${PROJECT_NAME}.h\"\n")
file(APPEND ${AUTO_GEN_FILE} "// other contents of auto_gen.h go here\n")
```

Instead of hardcoding the project name as "MyProject", we're using the `${PROJECT_NAME}` variable to get the name of your project.

2. In your source files, you can include the generated header file using:

```
#include "auto_gen.h"
```

This will include the generated header file that includes the header file with the same name as your project, and any other contents you added in the `file(APPEND ...)` command.

---

Yes, you can search for a header file that contains a specific macro, such as `CLASS_NAME`, and then include that header file in `auto_gen.h` using CMake.

Here's an example of how you can do it:

1. In your `CMakeLists.txt` file, add the following lines:

```
set(AUTO_GEN_FILE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/auto_gen.h)
file(WRITE ${AUTO_GEN_FILE} "// automatically generated file\n")

# search for a header file that contains the CLASS_NAME macro
file(GLOB_RECURSE HEADER_FILES "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/*.h")
foreach(header ${HEADER_FILES})
    file(READ ${header} header_contents)
    if(header_contents MATCHES ".*#define[ \t]+CLASS_NAME.*")
        file(APPEND ${AUTO_GEN_FILE} "#include \"${header}\"\n")
    endif()
endforeach()

file(APPEND ${AUTO_GEN_FILE} "// other contents of auto_gen.h go here\n")
```

The `file(GLOB_RECURSE ...)` command searches for all header files in the current source directory and its subdirectories. The `foreach()` loop goes through each header file, reads its contents using `file(READ ...)`, and checks if it contains the `CLASS_NAME` macro using a regular expression. If the macro is found, the `file(APPEND ...)` command appends an `#include` directive for that header file to `auto_gen.h`.

2. In your source files, you can include the generated header file using:

```
#include "auto_gen.h"
```

This will include the generated header file that includes the header file with the `CLASS_NAME` macro, and any other contents you added in the `file(APPEND ...)` command.

Note that this approach assumes that the `CLASS_NAME` macro is defined using `#define` in the header file. If the macro is defined using a different method, you may need to adjust the regular expression used in the `if()` statement.
