Certainly! Here's a simple example that demonstrates how to use the `engine::application` class and the `ENGINE_GAME` macro to create a custom game class and run it:

First, create a new directory for the project and create a file called `engine.hpp` with the following contents:

```
#ifndef ENGINE_HPP
#define ENGINE_HPP

#include <iostream>

namespace engine {

    // Base class for game applications
    class application {
    public:
        virtual ~application() {}

        // Main game loop
        virtual void run() {
            std::cout << "Running game...\n";
            DoSomething();
        }

        // Override this function in the derived class to do something
        virtual void DoSomething() {}
    };

    // Game engine class
    class game {
    public:
        game(application* app) : app_(app) {}
        ~game() {}

        // Run the game
        void run() {
            app_->run();
        }

    private:
        application* app_;
    };

} // namespace engine

#endif // ENGINE_HPP
```

This header file defines the `engine::application` and `engine::game` classes that are used in the example code you posted earlier.

Next, create a file called `my_game.hpp` with the following contents:

```
#ifndef MY_GAME_HPP
#define MY_GAME_HPP

#include "engine.hpp"

class my_game : public engine::application {
public:
    void DoSomething() override {
        std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
    }
};

// Register the game class with the engine
ENGINE_GAME(my_game);

#endif // MY_GAME_HPP
```

This header file defines a custom game class called `my_game` that inherits from `engine::application` and overrides its `DoSomething()` function. It also uses the `ENGINE_GAME` macro to register the `my_game` class with the game engine.

Finally, create a file called `main.cpp` with the following contents:

```
#include "engine.hpp"
#include "my_game.hpp"

int main() {
    // Create a new game instance and run it
    engine::game* game = new engine::game(new my_game());
    game->run();
    delete game;
    return 0;
}
```

This file creates a new game instance and runs it using the `engine::game` class.

To build and run the project, you can use a command like the following (assuming you're using `g++` as your compiler):

```
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o game && ./game
```

This should compile the code and output "Running game..." followed by "Hello World!" to the console.
